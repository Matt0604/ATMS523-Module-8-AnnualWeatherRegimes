# ATMS523-Module-8-AnnualWeatherRegimes
This repository is to satisfy my semester project for ATMS 523 at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Here, a set of year-long weather regimes (WRs) are created over the CONUS, setting the foundation for future research towards my Ph.D. dissertation. WRs are created using K-means clustering analysis of 5 clusters.
